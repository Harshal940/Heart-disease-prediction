# Heart-disease-prediction
This Python project focuses on predicting heart disease using machine learning techniques. The project aims to develop a predictive model that can assist in early detection and prevention of heart-related issues. It utilizes a dataset containing various patient features, such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc., to train a machine learning model. The trained model is then used to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on their input information. The performance of the model is evaluated using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The project provides a user-friendly web-based interface to input patient information and obtain heart disease predictions. Contributions to the project are welcome to improve and enhance the prediction capabilities.
